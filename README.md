# FloodVision: Flood Risk Prediction and Disaster Awareness Platform Using Machine Learning

# Overview: 
AquaShield AI is a Machine Learning–based Flood Risk Prediction and Impact Assessment platform designed to analyze environmental and geographic conditions to estimate flood risk levels.
This system functions as a data-driven decision support and awareness tool. Users provide environmental inputs, and the trained ML model predicts flood risk and potential impact severity.
**This is not a real-time alerting system, but a predictive and educational platform built for analysis, preparedness, and disaster awareness.

# Objectives:
1.Predict flood risk using Machine Learning
2.Estimate possible impact severity and damge in INR
3.Increase disaster awareness
4.Provide safety guidelines
5.Share emergency contacts and NGO resources
6.Visualize flood-prone areas on interactive maps

Prediction Parameters (Model Features)

The ML model uses multiple environmental and geographic factors:

Feature and	Purpose
 Rainfall (1-day average) :	Detects immediate flood triggers
 Rainfall (7-day average) :	Short-term water accumulation
 Rainfall (1-month average)	Long-term ground saturation
 Location Details : Longitude and Latitude
 Nearby Water Bodies	: Identifies overflow risk from rivers/lakes
 Elevation :	Low-lying areas have higher flood probability
 Geographic Data	:  land characteristics
 Impervious factor : Measures non-absorbent surfaces
 Land cover index : Identifies land type; determines water absorption and runoff behavior.
